# SPY Lab (ETH Zurich)

The Secure and Private AI (SPY) Lab conducts research on the security, privacy and trustworthiness of machine learning systems. We often approach these problems from an adversarial perspective, by designing attacks that probe the worst-case performance of a system to ultimately understand and improve its safety.
